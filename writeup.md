## **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

---

## Reflection

### 1. My Pipeline

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps.  

1. Extraction of the Lane Color(white, yellow)
1. Color Conversion(grayscale)
1. Smoothing
1. Edge Detection
1. Region Selection
1. Line Detection
1. Post-Processing

#### Extraction of the Lane Color(white and yellow)

#### Color Conversion

#### Smoothing

#### Edge Detection

#### Region Selection using ROI(Region Of Interest)

#### Hough Transform

#### Post-Processing

### 2. Identification of potential shortcomings with my current pipeline
- Change of the setting of camera
- Differentã€€lighting conditions 

### 3. Suggestion of possible improvements to my pipeline
